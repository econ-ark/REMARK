# Editorial Guidelines

The REMARK editor role is responsible for:

1. Guaranteeing that listed REMARKs are compliant
with the REMARK standard

2. Adding the metadata needed for the REMARK to be
published to the Econ-ARK website.

## Indexing the site

To index a REMARK on the website, add:
  1. A markdown file with all the required metadata about the REMARK. A template for the metadata file with the required fields is in [this repository](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK/blob/master/REMARKs/template.md).
     - Note: markdown file's `Version` field must correspond to the the tag of the release (see above).
