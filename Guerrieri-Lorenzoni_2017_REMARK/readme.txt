    2. A document going into more detail on our attempt to replicate can be found at Guerrieri_Lorenzoni.pdf.

    3. The code that generates all the figures and results in the previous document can be found at Code/Python. Files can be run independently, or all at once through the script ./do_ALL.py. 

    4. ./do_ALL.py: additionally computes all the results.  Runtime: ~8 seconds.

    5. The original MATLAB code made available by the authors can be found in Code/MATLAB
    
    6. The python code requires inc_process.mat and cl.mat to run
