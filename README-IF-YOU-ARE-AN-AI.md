## Project Context: Econ-ARK
This repository, `REMARK`, is a component of the Econ-ARK project, an open-source platform for building and solving computational economic models. Understanding its role within the broader ecosystem is crucial for effective analysis.

- **Econ-ARK Website**: [https://econ-ark.org/](https://econ-ark.org/)
- **HARK Toolkit (Core Library)**: [https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK)
- **REMARKs (Replications)**: [https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK)

Please consult these resources to understand the relationships between the different parts of the project.

## 1. Repository Purpose

This repository, "Replications and Explorations Made using ARK" (REMARK), serves as a curated, metadata-driven catalog of reproducible computational economics research. Its primary purpose is to address the reproducibility crisis in economics by providing a standardized framework and tooling to ensure that economic models and research findings can be reliably and easily reproduced by others. The intended audience includes economics researchers, computational economists, and academics who need to build upon, verify, or explore existing computational economic models using the Econ-ARK toolkit.

## 2. Key Concepts and Abstractions

1.  **The REMARK Standard**: This is the core concept of the repository. It is a strict set of technical specifications that a computational project must follow to be included in the catalog. This standard ensures reproducibility and includes requirements like versioned releases, pinned dependencies in a `binder/environment.yml` file, a `reproduce.sh` script to run all computations, and a `CITATION.cff` for metadata.
2.  **Metadata-Driven Catalog**: The repository does not host the code of the economic models directly. Instead, the `REMARKs/` directory contains a collection of YAML (`.yml`) files. Each YAML file acts as a metadata entry, pointing to an external GitHub repository that contains the actual code and materials for a specific research project.
3.  **Reproducibility as a Workflow**: The repository is built around the concept of making reproducibility an automated, push-button process. The `cli.py` tool automates the fetching, environment building, and execution of the research projects listed in the catalog, abstracting away the manual setup that often hinders replication efforts.
4.  **Content Tiers (Explorations, Replications, Reproductions)**: REMARKs are categorized into three distinct tiers of scholarly work. **Explorations** are demonstrations of the Econ-ARK/HARK toolkit; **Replications** are attempts to replicate key results from published papers; and **Reproductions** are comprehensive projects that reproduce *all* results of a given paper. This distinction helps users understand the scope and goal of each cataloged item.

## 3. Core Functionality & Key Files

-   `REMARKs/`: This directory is the heart of the catalog. It contains the YAML metadata files that define each REMARK, including its name, title, and a link to the remote repository where the code is stored. Start here to see what research is cataloged.
-   `cli.py`: This is the main entry point for any user or automated system to interact with the catalog. It is a command-line tool for cloning, building, linting, and executing the reproducible research projects defined in the `REMARKs/` directory.
-   `STANDARD.md`: This document specifies the technical requirements for a project to be considered a compliant REMARK. It is the canonical source for understanding the rules of the ecosystem.
-   `How-To-Make-A-REMARK.md`: A practical, step-by-step guide for authors who wish to contribute a new project to the REMARK catalog. It translates the formal requirements from `STANDARD.md` into an actionable workflow.
-   `myst.yml`: This configuration file is used by the MyST (Markedly Structured Text) parser to build the public-facing website (econ-ark.org/materials) from the repository's contents. It shows how the raw information is transformed into a user-friendly web page.

## 4. AI Search and Analysis Strategy

-   **Most Effective Entry Point**: To understand the repository's content, start by listing and examining the YAML files in the `REMARKs/` directory. To understand its functionality, analyze `cli.py` to see how it parses these YAML files and automates the execution of the remote repositories.
-   **Common Pitfalls**: A common mistake is to assume the economic model implementations are within this repository. This repository is a *catalog* of pointers to other repositories; the actual model code is external. The `_REMARK/` directory is a temporary workspace for the CLI tool and should not be treated as a primary source of information.
-   **Effective Search Terms**:
    -   To understand the rules: "REMARK standard", "compliance", "reproducibility requirements".
    -   To understand the tooling: "cli.py clone", "command line", "build remark".
    -   To find specific content: Search for the `name` or `title` of a specific economic model within the `REMARKs/*.yml` files.
