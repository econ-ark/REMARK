# Two Versions of Install Files

The full distribution of LaTeX includes some valuable features that are not incorporated in 
the version distributed by default with matplotlib. (In particular, useful tools from the amsmath
package are missing).

To build a VM that installs the full-blown LaTeX (with amsmatn), move the "latex-add" versions of files in this directory to the corresponding filename without "latex-add" - and be prepared to wait several minutes every time you launch a new notebook.
