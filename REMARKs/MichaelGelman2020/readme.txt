  1. A notebook attempting to replicate the paper's main results using HARK can be found at code/python/Michael_Gelman_MPC_replication.ipynb.

  2. A document going into more detail on our attempt to replicate can be found at Michael_Gelman_2020.pdf.

  3. The code that generates all the figures and results in the previous document can be found at Code/Python. Files can be run independently,
