# A replication by [Jionglin Andy Zheng].

## Description [modify]

This repository corresponds to the [Course Project](https://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/courses/Topics/Syllabus.html) of the course Advanced Macroeconomics II at Johns Hopkins University, by Professor Christopher D. Carroll.

## Location of main files:
  1. A notebook attempting to replicate the paper's main results using HARK can be found at Code/Python/Michael_Gelman_MPC_replication.ipynb.

  2. A document going into more detail on our attempt to replicate can be found at Michael_Gelman_2020.pdf.

  3. The code that generates all the figures and results in the previous document can be found at Code/Python. Files can be run independently, 
     or all at once through the scrip ./do_ALL.py. 

  4. ./do_ALL.py: additionally computes all the results.
