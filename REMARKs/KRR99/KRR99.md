# On the Size of U.S. Government: Political Economy in the Neoclassical Growth Model

## Replication of Krusell and Rios-Rull (1999)
 
## by Kyung Woong Koh
 
This notebook attempts to replicate "On the Size of U.S. Government: Political Economy in the Neoclassical Growth Model" by Krusell and Rios-Rull (1999), by incorporating a flat income tax rate and lump-sum transfers into an economy with idiosyncratic transitory income shocks, then computing the tax rate chosen by the median agent.
