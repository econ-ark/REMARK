    2. A document going into more detail on our attempt to replicate can be found at GL2017.pdf.

    3. The code that generates all the figures and results in the previous document can be found at Code/Python. Files can be run independently, or all at once through the script ./do_ALL.py. 

    4. ./do_ALL.py: additionally computes all the results.  Runtime: ~8 seconds.

    5. The original MATLAB code made available by the authors can be found in Code/MATLAB
    
    6. The python code requires inc_process.mat and cl.mat to run
