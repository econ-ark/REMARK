# SolvingMicroDSOPs Is an Exploration of Indirect Inference for a Life Cycle Model
abstract: "These notes describe tools for solving microeconomic dynamic stochastic optimization problems, and show how to use those tools for efficiently estimating a standard life cycle consumption/saving model using microeconomic data.  No attempt is made at a systematic overview of the many possible technical choices; instead, I present a specific set of methods that have proven useful in my own work (and explain why other popular methods, such as value function iteration, are a bad idea).  Paired with these notes is Mathematica, Matlab, and Python software that solves the problems described in the text." # abstract: optional
