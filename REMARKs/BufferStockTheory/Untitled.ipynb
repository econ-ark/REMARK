    "\n",
    "1. Unemployment is a transitory event\n",
    "2. An unemployed HH has a very low transitory income.\n",
    "3. Contingent on becoming unemployed, the expected permanent income drops by 10% (a la von Wachter and others).\n",
    "    * In normal times, the likelihood of going to a very low states of the permanent component of income is very low.\n",
    "    * However, in bad times, the likelihood of going to very low states increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The specification\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to describe the income process, we need 3 state variables,\n",
    "  * $\\omega$ -- employment (or aggregate) state.\n",
    "  * $\\mathbb{p}$ -- persistent component of income.\n",
    "  * $\\theta$ -- transitory component of income.\n",
    "* $\\omega$ -- employment state (or can be called an aggregate state, in which case it becomes H,L rather than e,u)\n",
    "  * 2-state Markov chain: $\\omega \\in \\Omega=\\{e,u\\}$\n",
    "  * Denoting the transition probability of switching from employment (unemployment) in period $t$ to employment (unemployment) in period $t+1$ by $\\rho_{e}$ ($\\rho_{u}$), the transition matrix is given by:\n",
    "    * $\\pi = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \\rho_{e} & 1-\\rho_{e}\\\\ 1-\\rho_{u} & \\rho_{u} \\end{array}\\right)$\n",
    "* $\\mathbb{P}$ -- Persistent component of income.\n",
    "  * 3-state Markov chain: $\\mathbb{p} \\in \\mathbb{P}= \\{\\mathbb{p}_{1},\\mathbb{p}_{2},\\mathbb{p}_{3}\\}$\n",
    "  * *The transition probabilities for this Markov process depend on the employment state and are given by $\\lambda(\\mathbb{p}'|\\mathbb{p},\\omega,\\omega')$. Assuming the law of large numbers, the idiosyncratic risk averages out, and only the aggregate risk determines the number of agents in a specific idiosyncratic persistent income state, $\\mathbb{p}$. Moreover, we assume that the share of households in a given idiosyncratic persistent income state $\\mathbb{p}$ only depends on the current aggregate state $\\omega$. This assumption imposes consistency restrictions on the transition matrix $\\lambda(\\mathbb{p}'|\\mathbb{p},\\omega,\\omega')$.*\n",
