Defining $\\underline{\\kappa}$ as the perfect foresight model's MPC, this implies that $\\lim_{m_{t}~\\uparrow~\\infty} c^{\\prime}(m) = \\underline{\\kappa}$.  \n",

Strict concavity of the consumption function implies that the consumption function will be everywhere below a function $\\bar{\\kappa}m$, and strictly declining everywhere.  The last figure plots the MPC between these two limits."
