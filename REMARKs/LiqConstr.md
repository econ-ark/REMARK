# Liquidity Constraints and Precautionary Saving

The LiqConstr directory contains code to reproduce the figures of the paper [Liquidity Constraints and Precautionary Saving](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/LiqConstr/) by Carroll, Holm, and Kimball,
and the LaTeX source to produce the paper once the figures have been created.

## Code 

Figures can be produced either:

1. Live in your (Chrome) browser using [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/econ-ark/REMARK/master?filepath=REMARKs%2FLiqConstr%2FLiqConstr.ipynb)
1. Locally by running an ipython program on your computer:
   1. [Install the necessary tools on your computer](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK)
   1. From the directory `REMARK/REMARKs/LiqConstr`, run `do_all.py`
      `ipython do_all.py`
1. In a local interactive [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org)
   1. [install the jupyter notebook tool] per [Installation.md](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK)
   2. Change to the `REMARK/REMARKs/LiqConstr` directory
   1. Type `jupyter notebook` at the command line
   1. Click on `LiqConstr.ipynb`
	  
## Paper

The paper can be generated by compiling the LaTeX file `LiqConstr.tex` using a standard 
distribution of LaTeX like TeXLive or Overleaf.
