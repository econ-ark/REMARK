    "Will and I have drawn largely on the recent work of Auclert, Rognlie, and Straub (\"ARS\"), which I know you are familiar with as well.  We have been particularly eager to make sure to incorporate sticky wages as well as sticky prices because it seems increasingly clear, as a practical matter, that sticky wages are more important than sticky prices in explaining various business cycle phenomena.  \n",

    "We have simplified their  model to eliminate the illiquid asset - now all assets are assumed to be liquid, and it is my guess that one lesson of our paper may be that very little of value is gained from the considerable complexity and confusion added by incorporation of the illiquid asset.  In any case, eliminiating it is a good starting point.\n",
